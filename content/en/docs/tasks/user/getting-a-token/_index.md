title: Obtaining an IAM access token from a CLI
weight: 1
---

A token can be obtained from a command-line interface (CLI) in two ways:

- using `oidc-agent`
- using scripts linked to this page, using the resource-owner password
  credentials flow or the OAuth device flow

In this section we recommend the installations of a set of tools that can help
in managing tokens.

## Obtaining a token using `oidc-agent`

[oidc-agent][oidc-agent] is a useful tool to easily get and manage access
tokens for command-line applications.

### Installing oidc-agent

See [oidc-agent installation
instructions](https://indigo-dc.gitbook.io/oidc-agent/installation/install).

#### Quick CENTOS7 installation instructions

This recipe shows how to quickly install `oidc-agent` on CENTOS 7.

```bash
$ yum -y install epel-release
$ yum -y install https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent/releases/download/v3.3.1/oidc-agent-3.3.1-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

### Bootstrapping oidc-agent

The first thing to do is to start `oidc-agent`.
This can be done issuing the following command:

```bash
$ eval $(oidc-agent)
Agent pid 62088
```

### Registering a client

In order to obtain a token out of IAM, a user needs a client registered.
`oidc-agent` can automate this step and store client credentials securely
on the user machine. This is a one-time operation, you do not need a new
client every time you need a token.

A new client can be registered using the `oidc-gen` command, as follows:

```bash
$ oidc-gen -w device wlcg
```

The `-w device` instructs `oidc-agent` to use the device code flow for the
authentication, which is the recommended way with IAM.

oidc-agent will display a list of different providers that can be used for
registration:

```bash
[1] https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/
[2] https://iam-test.indigo-datacloud.eu/
...
[20] https://oidc.scc.kit.edu/auth/realms/kit/
```

Select one of the registered providers, or type a custom issuer (for IAM, the
last character of the issuer string is always a `/`, e.g.
`https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/`).

Then oidc-agent asks for the scopes, typing `max` (without quotes) allows to
get all the allowed scopes.

oidc-agent will register a new client and store the client credentials and a
refresh token locally in encrypted form (the agent will ask for a password from
the user).

As mentioned, `oidc-gen` is meant to be used only once, when you need a client registered.

### Managing oidc-agent account configurations

To see the list of locally configured accounts use the following command:

```bash
> oidc-add -l

The following account configurations are usable:
DEEP-ac
XDC
atlas
...
cms-voms-importer
escape
escape-monitoring
iam-test
infn-cloud
wlcg
```

You can then load an account in the agent again with the oidc-add command, as follows:

```bash
oidc-add wlcg
```

Once you've loaded the account, you can use `oidc-token` to get tokens for that account.

### Getting tokens with `oidc-token`

Tokens can be obtained using the `oidc-token` command, as follows:

```bash
oidc-token wlcg
```

This will request a token with all the scopes requested at client registration
time. To limit the scopes included in the token, the `-s` flag can be used, as
follows:

```bash
oidc-token -s storage.read:/ wlcg
```

The token audience can be limited using the `--aud` flag,

```bash
oidc-token --aud example.audience -s storage.read:/ wlcg
```
### Accessing oidc-agent client configuration

Often is useful to get details about the client configuration generated 
by oidc-agent. This can be done with the `oidc-gen -p` command, that is
used to print a client configuration, as in the following example:

```bash
‚ùØ oidc-gen -p wlcg
Enter decryption password for account config 'wlcg':******

}
```
## Obtaining a token with the password flow

The [password flow][oauth-password-flow] allows a user to get a token from the
IAM by using the IAM local credentials (i.e. the username/password credentials
setup at IAM registration time).

In order to use the password flow, a non-privileged user has to:

1. register a client following the instructions given in [the client
  registration][client-registration] section
2. Note down the `client_id` of the generated client and ask an IAM
   administrator to enable the password flow for such client
3. Wait until the client as the password flow enabled
4. Use a script similar to the one given [here][get-token-script] (or write
   your own following the recommendations of the [RFC][oauth-password-flow]) to
   obtain a token out of the IAM

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}

While this approach is viable, it is __deprecated__ since:

- it forces the user to request the activation of the password flow for the
  client (it is disabled by default for dynamically registered clients)
- it forces the user to authenticate with the local IAM credentials (external
  authentication mechanisms such as Google or SAML cannot be used)
- it exposes the user credentials to the client application

The device code flow, described in the next section, does not have these
limitations and should be preferred over the password flow.

{{% /alert %}}


## Obtaining a token with the device code flow

The [device code flow][oauth-device-code-flow] allows a user to get a token
from the IAM from a CLI interface while using an external browser for the
authentication step. This is convenient since:

- it does not require any authorization from administrators (the device code
  flow can be requested by the user at client registration time)
- it allows the user to authenticate with any of the authentication mechanisms
  supported by the IAM
- it __does not__ expose the user credentials to the client application

For nitty and gritty details on how the flow works, see the
[RFC][oauth-device-code-flow].

After having registered a client with the device flow enabled (see [client
registration section][client-registration-ref]), the device code flow can be
used to obtain a token using a script like the one [here][dc-get-token-script]
which does the following:

- contacts the device flow endpoint to start a device flow authentication and
  authorization
- prints code information on the terminal
- waits for user input to proceed and obtain the token(s)
