title: Managing SSH keys 
---

Starting with version `v1.7.0`, IAM allows users to link SSH public keys to
their accounts.

SSH keys are then exposed to relying parties in two ways:

- through the IAM [SCIM APIs][scim-apis];
- as a claim in the OpenID Connect `userinfo` endpoint response, if the token
  has the `ssh-keys` scope. 

## Managing account SSH keys

The IAM dashboard allows a user to link one or more SSH keys to their account,
as shown below:

## Accessing account SSH keys via SCIM APIs

As clarified in the [SCIM APIs documentation][scim-apis], ssh keys are exposed
in the user information returned to authorized clients, as in the following
fragment: 

```json
{
  "id": "80e5fb8d-b7c8-451a-89ba-346ae278a66f",
  ...
  "userName": "test",
  "urn:indigo-dc:scim:schemas:IndigoUser": {
    "sshKeys": [
      {
        "display": "my-key",
        "primary": true,
        "value": "ssh-rsa AAAAB...", 
        "fingerprint": "M9vqQeuPrPI0wiaT6sftgfxu1/kowbb37fcLU2+R7yk=",
        "created": "2021-08-25T15:18:45.978+02:00",
        "lastModified": "2021-08-25T15:18:45.978+02:00"
      }
    ],
  }
}
```

## Accessing account SSH keys via the userinfo endpoint

SSH keys linked to a user account are returned in the userinfo endpoint
response if the token used to access the endpoint has the `ssh-keys` scope, as
in the following example:

```console
‚ùØ curl -s -L -H "Authorization: Bearer ${AT}" https://iam.local.io/userinfo | jq .
{
  "sub": "80e5fb8d-b7c8-451a-89ba-346ae278a66f",
  "ssh_keys": [
    {
      "fingerprint": "M9vqQeuPrPI0wiaT6sftgfxu1/kowbb37fcLU2+R7yk=",
      "value": "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that the `ssh-keys` scope is a **restricted** scope, i.e., it can be
assigned to client registered in IAM only by IAM administrators.
