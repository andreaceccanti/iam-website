title: Statistical endpoint
---

Starting from v1.10.0 version, a statistical endpoint showing the number of users in the IAM organization was added.

The endpoint does not require authentication and is available at `/stats`. An example:

```json
$ curl http://localhost:8080/stats --silent | jq
{
  "numberOfUsers": 255
}
```

The output may be populated with more information in later versions.
