  INFN offers IAM-as-a-service to partner communities.
---


INFN has provided IAM as a service to partner research communities. In this
scenario, a dedicated IAM instance is deployed on the INFN infrastructure and
configured according to the community needs.

INFN takes care of keeping the service operational and up-to-date, while
administrative control on the IAM instance is granted to the community.
