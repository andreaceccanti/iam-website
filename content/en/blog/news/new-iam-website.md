The IAM website and documentation has [moved](https://indigo-iam.github.io),
and if you're reading this you already know.

The new IAM website is powered by [Docsy][docsy], a [Hugo][hugo] theme for
creating technical documentation sites, which is increasingly popular in Open
Source projects.  

The new site provides new and improved documentation.

If you find something is missing or broken, let us know by opening an issue
or suggest changes. The new Docsy website makes this very easy to anyone with a
Github account, just see the tab on the right of each page.
