The IAM website and documentation has [moved](https://indigo-iam.github.io),
and if you're reading this you already know.

The new IAM website is powered by [Docsy][docsy], a [Hugo][hugo] theme for
creating technical documentation sites, which is increasingly popular in Open
Source projects.  

We think moving to Docsy improved the quality of IAM documentation. If you find
something is missing or broken, let us know by opening an issue on the [IAM
Website GitHub repo][iam-website-gh].
