The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v1.10.0.

This release provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

The major highlights include:

* E-mail notification for AUP reminder/expiration, account suspension/restoration and client disabled/enabled events
* Add a statistical endpoint which shows the number of IAM users
* Allow for a definition of a set of default groups, automatically linked to newly registered users
* Mandate the usage of a stronger user password (during the password reset step)
* Allow to set a property which disables any kind of IAM cache

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
