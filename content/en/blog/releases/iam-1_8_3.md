The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v.1.8.3.

This release provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

The major highlights include:

* save access token value as an hash and add missing foreign keys to the database
  * because of this change, we __strongly__ recommend to __make a backup of your database__ before upgrading to v1.8.3. The migration will take an amount of time which will be proportional to the amount of currently active access tokens, which could be very long
* enable scope matchers and well-known endpoint caching on a Redis server
* consider scope matcher based on string equality for custom scopes
* fix CERN workflow for restored accounts.

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
