The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v1.8.3.

This release provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

The major highlights include:

* save an access token value as a hash and add missing foreign keys to the database
  * because of this change, we __strongly__ recommend to __make a backup of your database__ before upgrading to v1.8.3. The migration will take an amount of time which will be proportional to the amount of currently active access tokens, which could be very long
* enable caching of scope matchers and of the contents of the well-known endpoint on a Redis server
* match custom scopes based on string equality
* fix CERN workflow for restored accounts
* fix authorization on IAM APIs such to avoid cases where access is granted to already approved scopes instead of effective token scopes.

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
