The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v.1.8.2.

This release provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

The major highlights include:

* addition of new admin scopes in order to access IAM API endpoints
    * an administrator access token is not enough to have full access to IAM API endpoints; `iam:admin.read` and `iam:admin.write` scopes are required
* Spring-Boot update to version 2.6.14

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
