The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v.1.8.4.

This fast release is mainly focussed on the limitation of the client_credential grant type, which is now enableable only by registered IAM users (admins or normal users).

This release also provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
