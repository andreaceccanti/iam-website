The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v1.8.4.

This release is mainly focused on the limitation of the client_credentials grant type, which can be set only by registered IAM users (admins or normal users) in a Client registration/update request.

This release also provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
