The IAM development team is pleased to announce a fast release of INDIGO IAM v1.10.1.

This release mainly provides bug fixes, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

The fast release is motivated by the need of fixing the lifecycle user suspension.

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
