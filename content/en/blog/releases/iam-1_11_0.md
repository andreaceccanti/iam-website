The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v1.11.0.

The main feature of this release is the possibility to enable the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) through a button in the user homepage. This is an experimental feature and will be enhanced in future releases, based also on user feedback. The `mfa` Spring profile is used to enable MFA functionality.

This release also provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
