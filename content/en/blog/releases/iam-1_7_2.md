The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of [INDIGO IAM
v.1.7.2][release-notes].

This release paves the way for the upgrade to v1.8.0 which will provide an
update of the core Spring dependencies IAM is built upon.

In order to enable a smooth transition without requiring manual interventions
from deployers, we need to issue an intermediate release that just updates the
version of the [flyway library][flyway] that is used to manage the database
schema updates. 

No other change is introduced with this release.

As usual, the IAM docker images can be obtained from DockerHub, while RPM
packages for CENTOS 7 can be obtained from our [package repository][repo].
