The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v1.10.2.

This release mainly provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

The major highlight includes a stronger password quality check, which needs to meet the following criteria:

* at least 8 characters long
* include at least one uppercase letter
* include at least one lowercase letter
* include at least one number
* include at least one special character (e.g., @$!%*?&).

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
