The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v1.9.0.

This release introduces new features, including:

* Administrators have the ability to disable a client
* VO members can re-sign the AUP whenever they choose
* Clients now have a _last used_ property to find out when was the last time it was used
* It is now possible to add a _nickname_ as an attribute during the registration process

This release also provides bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

As usual, the IAM docker image can be obtained from [DockerHub][iam-login-service-docker].
