The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v.1.7.1.

This release fixes a problem introduced in v1.7.0 of the IAM test client
application released last week that prevented its correct behaviour.

Also starting with this release IAM test client does not expose received tokens
in the default configuration. In order to restore the previous behaviour, set
the following envirnoment variable:

```bash
IAM_CLIENT_HIDE_TOKENS=false
```
or, in the `application.yml` file use:

```yaml
iam:
  hide-tokens: false
```

More information in the [release notes][release-notes].

This release provide updates only for the iam-test-client application, which is
only released as a Docker image on DockerHub.
