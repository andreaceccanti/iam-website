The IAM development team is pleased to announce the release of INDIGO IAM v.1.7.0.

This release provides many bug fixes and enhancements, as can be seen in the [release notes][release-notes].

The highlights of this release are:

- **Scalability improvements**: the group membership persistence management has
  been refactored to improve scalability; SCIM APIs have also been changed to
  support pagination over group members (see the new [SCIM API][scim-apis]
  documentation for more information);
- **Improved token exchange flexibility**: token exchange can now be controlled
  in more detail using [scope][scope-policy-api] and [token
  exchange][token-exchange-policy-api] policies;
- **SSH key management**: IAM now allows users to link SSH keys to their account;
  ssh keys are then exposed to relying parties either via the SCIM APIs or via
  the OpenID connect userinfo endpoint; see the [documentation][ssh-doc].

As usual, the IAM docker images can be obtained from DockerHub, while RPM
packages for CENTOS 7can be obtained from our [package repository][repo].
